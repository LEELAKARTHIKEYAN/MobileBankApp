# Mobile Bank App UI ‚úî
## About
This Mobile Bank App is made using React Native which has a design inspired by this [dribble  design](https://dribbble.com/shots/13547910-Mobile-bank-App-Design).

## Images of the App
- This is the screen when we open the App, Here we can the see the Activity indicator in top right corner when App loads initially :

- Now we can see the refresh Icon, instead of loader :
<img src="assests/ScreenShots/refreshIcon.jpeg" width="300" height="600"/>

- When we press the View card button , we can see the details of your card :
<img src="assests/ScreenShots/cardview.jpeg" width="300" height="600"/>

- Used a ScrollView to display the expenditures :
